USE POSTMAN ENVIRONMENTS AND COLLECTIONS

Environments allows to define environment variables for different categories.
Like EShop.Docker and EShopLocalhost. 
EShop.Docker will store https://localhost:6060 - https://localhost:6063
EShopLocalhost will store https://localhost:5050 - https://localhost:5053
To access variables, select category in upper right corner on window.
Now write {{VARIABLE_NAME}} somewhere, for example in url: "{{catalog_url}}/products"

Collections allow grouping requests into different folders within a collection.
Create collection and folders for all microservices.
Add request and use environment variables like "{{catalog_url}}/products"
